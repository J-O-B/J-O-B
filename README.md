Firstly, welcome to my Github! As a full stack developer, within these repos you 
will find a range of projects covering both front and back end development. including 
everything from basic front end projects to full stack web applications, Neural 
networks to automated / arbitrage trading bots.

As a full stack developer with interests in machine learning, artificial intelligence 
and finance, I am currently looking for work preferably within the financial / 
fintech sector, however, I am open to freelance work and collaboration on side 
projects.
